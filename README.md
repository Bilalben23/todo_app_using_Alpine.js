# Alpine.js mini project:

AlpineJS is a lightweigth framework, it it has declarative syntax which makes it so easy to learn.
- I learned the basic with [The codeholic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ILDMMLgX0E), 
- and also I used the Alpine docs: [Alpine docs](https://alpinejs.dev/)
---
- In this project I created a simple to-do app, where you can add your tasks, and mark them as completed or remove them if you want.
- I applied many Apline.js things, like:
  - `x-data`: to create Alpine component.
  -  click event `@click` to handle user clicks.
  -  and more...
